## Overview of the Analysis 
The purpose is to have a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addtion to the data, we have added table filters for the citiy, state, country and shape.
## Results
To perform a search, users can enter different criterias in the search box. After the search box(s) is filled, the results will show just for that searching criteria.

## Summary
One draw back of this webpage is no visualization If the locations can be marked on the map using Google API and people can click on the world map for more details. 

As mentioned, there could have been more visualization such as media, google map overlay and etc. 
There also could be some built in dashbord to see the counts of spots for each state/city/country.
